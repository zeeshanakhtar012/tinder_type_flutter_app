  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/ring_tone/ringtone.mp3
    - assets/
    - assets/text_icons/
    - lib/views/layouts/
    - lib/views/layouts/item_event/
    - lib/views/layouts/item_event/event_button/
    - lib/views/layouts/item_subscription/
    - lib/views/layouts/item_forgotPassword/
    - lib/views/layouts/item_bottom_sheets_edit_profile_info/
    - assets/images/Image_call.png
    - lib/views/screens/screen_individual/
    - lib/controllers/
    - lib/controllers/event_controllers/
    - lib/controllers/users_controllers/
    - lib/controllers/authentication_controllers/
    - assets/icons/icon_flash_png.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Arial
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Arial/arialceb.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Arial/ArialMdm.ttf
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter/static/Inter-Regular.ttf
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
